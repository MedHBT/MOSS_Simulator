MOSS_Simulator
==============

Java application that display a file system.
Under a university project,me,Med Hassine Ben Taieb, and Amine Haddad we were asked to start study the software already
developed by Ray Ontko and to add some modifications to well deepen our knowledge in the file system. 
This application can simulate a file system like Linux and provide many functions(addusr, groupadd, passwd...).
We have added some functions and make a swing interface to ease the execution of all the functions.

The modified class : kernel
The added class : SyntxAnly/StartFrame/ProcessingFrame/Logger
